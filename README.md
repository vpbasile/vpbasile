- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vincent 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing tools to promote self-care and to assist people with dementia or other behavioral challenges.  
- ðŸŽ¨ I also enjoy making SVG Art, Web Dev, UX, and working with Microcontrollers.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Ollama after spending a couple of years doing nothing but React.
- ðŸ§© In my spare time, I like to work on a trivia game I made for my family to play at get togethers.
