- 👋 Hi, I’m Vincent 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing tools to promote self-care and to assist people with dementia or other behavioral challenges.  I also enjoy making SVG Art, Web Dev, UX, and working with Microcontrollers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Ollama.  In my spare time, I like to work on a trivia game I made for my family to play at get togethers.
- 💞️ I have a lot of experience working with large databases as well as X12 interfaces.
